TObj Operations

Methods:

TObj.set_TexAnim
# Assign a TexAnim directly to a TObj with custom starting frame and frame rate
# - instantiates an AObj for this TObj, freeing any previously assigned AObjs before construction
  args: rTObj, rTexAnim, fStart, fRate
  <-- rTObj, rTexAnim, rAObj

TObj.set_TexAnim_ints
# Alternative syntax uses high/low param in r5 to replace floating point inputs
  args: rTObj, rTexAnim, rParam
  <-- rTObj, rTexAnim, rAObj
  # rParam:
  #  +FFFF0000 = anim starting frame (0xFFFF -- unsigned hword; 0-bit mantissa)
  #  +0000FFFF = anim frame rate     (-0x7F.FF -- signed hword; 8-bit mantissa)
  

TObj.addAnimAll
# Assign a TexAnim directly to a TObj
  args: rTObj, rTexAnim
  # - instantiates an AObj for this TObj, freeing any previously assigned AObjs before construction

TObj.reqAnimAll
# Flags a TObj for animation, and sets a starting frame
  args: rTObj, fStart
[HSD, Punkline]

<TObj.addAnimAll> NTSC 1.02
# Assign a TexAnim directly to a TObj
# - instantiates an AObj for this TObj, freeing any previously assigned AObjs before construction

# --- args:
  # r3 = TObj
  # r4 = TexAnim
b 0x8035e708

<TObj.reqAnimAll> NTSC 1.02
# Flags a TObj for animation, and sets a starting frame

# --- args:
# r3 = TObj
# f1 = Anim Starting Frame
b 0x8035e800


# --- custom functions
<TObj.set_TexAnim> NTSC 1.02
# Assign a TexAnim directly to a TObj, with input ReqAnim and AObjRate float values
# - instantiates an AObj for this TObj, freeing any previously assigned AObjs before construction

# --- args:
# r3 = TObj
# r4 = TexAnim (links a TObj to an AObjDesc)
# f1 = Anim Starting Frame
# f2 = Anim Frame Rate

# --- returns:
# r3 = TObj (as given)
# r4 = TexAnim (as given)
# r5 = AObj (for this TObj)

<TObj.set_TexAnim_ints> NTSC 1.02
# Alternative version of set_TexAnim that uses integer inputs instead of floats:
# --- args:
# r3 = TObj
# r4 = TexAnim
# r5 = Params:
#      +FFFF0000 = anim starting frame (0xFFFF -- unsigned hword; 0-bit mantissa)
#      +0000FFFF = anim frame rate     (-0x7F.FF -- signed hword; 8-bit mantissa)

# --- returns:
# r3 = TObj (as given)
# r4 = TexAnim (as given)
# r5 = AObj (for this TObj)
