# the 'regs' macro helps us name registers counting up +1 or down +1 from a starting register (rN)

regs -1, /*
*/ (r31), rHand, rBase, rHandJObj, rInput, /*
*/ (r24), rIcon, rBackup, /*
*/ (r20), rIconID, rPlayerID

# -- these registers help us understand the context of this injection point
# 803f0a48 = base address in rBase


r13.xCSSJObjRoot    = -0x49E0
# r13 offset of root JObj for CSS icons/portraits


# code start:

mr rIcon, r3
mr rBackup, r4
# back these up for now, so that we don't disrupt the normal game program
# - the assigned registers in the above 'regs' call puts these in a safe place

load r4, MPad.addr
lwz r0, MPad.xOnPress(r4)
mtcrf MPad.crf.mDPad, r0
# We can check DPad button presses from the Master Pad .xOnPress bool field
# - loading it into cr directly lets us use the bools without having to compare anything

bf+ MPad.bDDown, 0f
  bl <CSS.icon_select_DDown>
0: bf+ MPad.bDUp, 1f
  bl <CSS.icon_select_DUp>
1: bf+ MPad.bDLeft, 2f
  bl <CSS.icon_select_DLeft>
2: bf+ MPad.bDRight, 3f
  bl <CSS.icon_select_DRight>
3: # This branch structure executes code according to DPad button presses...
# - each 'bf' line is a boolean branch condition 'branch if false'
# - each 'bl' line is a call to one of our custom handlers
# - each 'N:' number is a temporary label, which is reached with 'Nf' for 'forward' references


# You may edit the functions (defined below) to plug example code into these button presses

mr r4, rBackup
mr r3, rIcon
# recover old context before finishing injection code...

# original instruction, and return from injection:
lbz	r0, 0x0002 (r3)

# - change this function to something else to make something happen on DPad button presses
# - you may re-use the calling context for resources, despite it being unconventional:
